# pathfinder-vanilla

This is a Pathfinder game character sheet that I've been working on mostly as an exercise to get better at HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Given time, I will try to hook it up to an SQL backend. It is possible that a MongoDB backend would be better suited, but I haven't looked that deeply into it.

Current issues (besides being incomplete):

1. CSS for the nameplate lines: not justifying left and right, character name offset high
2. elements way too tall without using a 'label' even when not really needed
3. placeholder not working in Flat-footed modifiers textarea
